# CBC-track

**This repository is incomplete and unmaintained at this point. The code base is quite messy, slow, and clunky at the moment, and it will _likely_ not be updated further in Python. However, I may return to this project in the future, create a separate branch and rewrite it in R.**

Designed for tracking complete blood count (CBC) tests, their results, and potential correlations with medicines utilized.
